## My process

I started by deciding this was going to be a mobile first design, I thought it was a must. And also, it would have allowed me to play with different techniques. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand how to give an image a background color, to which I could not find a solution. 

The mobile first design was build using flex box because I thought it was going to be more comfortable, I regret some properties I used and specially my layout in the HTML code, it could be so much better.

The desktop website was build using grid because of its facilities when creating big objects in desktop screens. 

In general, it took me a considerable amount of time to build this easy design. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I should think ahead of time when creating HTML files, mostly because of future new resolutions that will change the whole design of an object and will also affect my CSS. 

Speaking of CSS. I should consider using a better way of assigning colours, fonts and sizes, that helps a lot when you want to have a better control over the whole website in different resolutions. 


### Continued development

Next time I would like to take my projects to a new level, like for example using Javascript on them. I should also work on CSS properties that could actually make the page not only more attractive but also more functional.
